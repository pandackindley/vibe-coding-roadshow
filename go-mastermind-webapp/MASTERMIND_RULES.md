# Mastermind Game Rules

Mastermind is a code-breaking game for two players. In this web app, you play against the computer.

## Objective

Guess the secret 4-color code generated by the computer. Each color is one of: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Purple.

## How to Play

- Enter a 4-color guess by selecting colors for each position.
- After each guess, you receive feedback:
  - **Black peg**: A color is correct and in the correct position.
  - **White peg**: A color is correct but in the wrong position.
- Use the feedback to deduce the secret code.
- You win when all 4 colors are correct and in the correct positions (4 black pegs).

## Example

- Secret code: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow
- Your guess: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow
- Feedback: 2 black (Red and Yellow are correct and in the right place), 2 white (Blue and Green are correct but swapped).

## Tips

- Colors may repeat in the code.
- Use logic and deduction to minimize the number of guesses.

Enjoy playing Mastermind!
